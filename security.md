# Security policy

We believe in transparency to mitigate security risks. All known vulnerabilities are available on 
our [security page](docs/modules/ROOT/pages/security.adoc).

We disclose such security issues only once a released version addressing the issue is available.

We use automated tools to review our docker images and dependencies.

# Reporting security vulnerabilities

To ensure safety of our users, security process needs to happen privately.

Here are the steps:

 - 1. Reporter email the issues privately to `twake[AT]linagora.com`.
 - 2. We will then evaluate the validity of your report, and write back to you within two weeks. This response time 
 accounts for vacation and will generally be quicker.
 - 3. We will propose a fix that we will review with you. This can take up to two weeks. 
 - 4. We will propose a draft for the announcement that we will review with you. 
 - 5. We will propose you a schedule for the release and the announcements.
 - 6. One week after the release we will disclose the vulnerability.
 
You will be credited in the vulnerability report for your findings.
